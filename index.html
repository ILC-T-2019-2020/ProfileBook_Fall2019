              Through my internships in the past, I have picked up skills in market research, outreach and expanding clientele, 
              with analysis of market trends being my forte. I also have exposure to financial modeling and prototyping, and am 
              confident in my ability in working with financial statements (building DCFs, income and cash flow statements is 
              nothing new to me). I also have basic experience in coding with C++ and am excited at the prospect of optimization 
              and enhancement of structural ideas. Finally I worked at a startup focused on financial empowerment amongst women in 
              Latin America over the summer, which allowed me to learn what goes into building a startup from scratch. Through 100 
              days, I hope to build a startup which revolves around something I am passionate about, particularly alleviating social
              issues or with a relation to a sustainable initiative.

              Currently, I am working with Prof. Emmanuelle Colonnelli at The Booth School of Business. 
              We are researching on startups and incubator programs in emerging markets like Africa. 
              This has helped me gain immense information regarding evaluating startups and the challenges
                faced by them. As an intern at Wishfin, a leading global fin-tech startup, I worked on mapping 
                out different parameters that affected consumer purchase patterns. I used R and excel to create 
                an algorithm that matched the best-performing agents with the most valuable consumers. This 
                taught me to approach every project analytically and allowed me to develop strong data-analysis 
                skills while crafting creative solutions to problems. Working as a market research intern at Bug 
                In Bug Out, a biotech startup competing in the New Venture Challenge, I conducted 30+ qualitative
                and quantitative in-person interviews with industry experts to assess the commercial potential 
                of our product. Contributing in such a foundational stage of the startup, I learnt the intricacies 
                of building companies from the ground-up and sharpened my entrepreneurial skills.

              I’m really interested in the intersection between entrepreneurship and 
              tech, as well as finance and tech. I have a strong arts background 
              (graphic design, visual arts, etc.) and research (both qualitative and 
              quantitative, in the arts and STEM field) and would probably be most 
              interested in the business development side. I really want to be able 
              to create a tangible company by the end of the 100 days and I’m definitely 
              willing to put aside a hefty amount of hours to do so. I have a couple of 
              ideas that would need the aid of someone who’s well-versed in code since
                they’re more on the app/website side, but I am also open to creating a 
                product as well. I really enjoy working with enthusiastic people who want 
                to work hard together!

                have a mentor while the researcher will get something in return

              I've built a company in the past. It’s an app that helps users offset their carbon footprint. 
              Because of it, over 4000 trees have been planted.

              I have some experience related to marketing and ui/ux for a startup, 
              so I can work with Photoshop, Sketch, Invision, etc. I am interested 
              in creating a website for UChicago where people can mark where they will 
              be during summer and winter vacations to promote new relationships 
              and meet-ups while we have the time to network. I know that Harvard 
              already has something similar and thought that it would be a nice 
              platform to have, although it may not necessarily generate any revenue. 
              I'm open to ideas though!

              I hope to learn more about how startups take their first steps. 
              I'm good with numbers and also looking at bigger picture ideas. 
              I think that an app that plans dates/hangouts would be cool, 
              but I'm open to work on anything!

              Having participated in multiple start-up competitions, I am familiar with the process of 
              brainstorming an idea and pitching it to investors. I bring a wealth of ideas to the table 
              and have creative business ideas. I am quite good with written and spoken communication
              as well as selling things. My interests are basketball, literature, history, finance and politics. 
              I want to come out of the 100 days project better equipped with entrepreneurship skills and a 
              more realistic view on what starting a company actually entails

                I've been a part of several case competitions (most recently 
                the Kraft Heinz x Bain and Co. case competition). I bring ideas and consistent 
                contributions to teams, since I believe that that’s a part of being a 
                good teammate, along with listening to others’ ideas and respecting their efforts.

                I am highly interested in technology, data science, and machine learning.
                 I would love to pursue a 100 days challenge project in the tech field (e.g. building an app). 
                 One idea I've been pondering with is creating a UChicago sportsbook where students 
                 can bet on various outcomes of professional sports
                 (if we can get around any legal issues with this).

                <b> Skills </b>I have very multicultural background (can speak six languages,

                have an eye for detail,a bit of a perfectionist, value quality over quantity.
                Also I have some experience with graphic design and video/image processing, 
                which could contribute to the marketing side of things.

                <b> Experience </b>
                I have interned at both a startup (Social Point - game developer
                in Barcelona, Spain) and a VC (Highland Europe - London, UK), gaining

                Out of the challenge, I am looking forward to gaining some real hands-on
                experience on developing a new venture. I would like to experience
                the process of acknowledging a problem and tackling it by coming up
                with different solutions - tying into learning from my team through
                collaboration.
